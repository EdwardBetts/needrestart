Changes in 0.3
==============

blacklisting
------------

It might be a bad idea to (auto) restart certain daemons. Therefor
a new config option is available to ignore binaries by matching
a regex. The supplied default configuration ignores dbus, NetworkManager
and various display managers.


user interface
--------------

The old basic user interface has been replace by a modular approach.
User interfaces are now implemented in the NeedRestart::UI::* packages.

New UI packages can ne added by putting them into perl's search path.
Using Module::Find to load any NeedRestart::UID::* package. Packagese
failing to load are ignored.

The following UI implementations are shipped:
* NeedRestart::UI::Debconf	- use Debian's debconf frontend
* NeedRestart::UI::Dialog	- use UI::Dialog
* NeedRestart::UI::stdio	- the simple old UI


sophisticated apt/dpkg trigger
------------------------------

The new apt/dpkg trigger only runs needrestart if there was a package
unpacked by dpkg and no error has occured during the dpkg run.

The scripts and config files required for the apt and dpkg integration
are installed by default.
